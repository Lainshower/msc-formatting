I might try pink next to show her a color she likes more.  <you> Oh that sounds great. I wish I could be braver to dye my hair a crazy color. I just stick to highlights.  <parter> I like those and once mine has grown out a bit im probably going to go that route. What color highlights do you get? <you> I usually get blonde and a reddish color i have light brown hair. Maybe next time i get my hair done i will just take the plunge and go for a bright all over color.  <parter> There are also really fun muted pastels <you> Oh maybe i will try that first then so it wont be too much of a shock to me.

Could you tell the difference in taste between the plant-based chicken and normal chicken? <parter> Plant-based chicken is less stringy, and a bit different in texture.

You can't really tell the difference, since it's all ground up anyways. <you> Oh, I really didn't know that. Maybe, after your explanation, I will give plant-based meats a try after all.

I really should listen to you more, I guess I am just set in my ways with a lot of things. Food being one of them.

Do you have a favorite one? Maybe you could recommend something.", "I really like the Harry Potter rides. Proposing in the Harry Potter area might add something extra magical to the moment if your girlfriend likes Harry Potter too.", "That's a good idea. She does like Harry Potter! Or maybe I could propose while we're eating foot-long corndogs, haha. Those are your favorite, right?", "They are! They aren't the most romantic food but they're really tasty.

Mine used to bring me a mouse to throw for her, just like a dog! And if you have 2 cats, they play with each other! Mine would run up and down the halls in the middle of the night, haha. Her name is Kyrie, and she walks off leash and is very obedient. Dogs might be hard to keep in your small apartment though, since Kyrie likes to play in the field, run with cars along the fence row, and herd goats. ", "Oh wow! So Kyrie is a working dog? She helps your dad out on the farm?", "She herds them for fun, haha. Goats mostly graze wherever they like in the fields, but she likes to group them up and walk them into a pen. My grandpa says it's from her cattle herding heritage.", "I like the idea of having so much space out in the country, but I think at heart I'm still a city girl.

I would say she should start smaller to be honest. Get a part of a larger work done and see how she likes it. It will take getting used to the pain as well.

My chili dog casserole recipe is delicious, fast and easy to make. I have a weekend job at a laboratory sequencing the genome. My lab is going to clone a jersey cow next year. I might take summer college classes before my freshman year. I have a night job as a fry cook, but I might get more hours in the fall. I want to major in molecular biology. I plan on quitting my night job this summer.", "session-05-dialogs": ["Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!", "I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?", "Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.", "Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.", "I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.", "That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!", "Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?", "Yes, more ice cream is always good, haha! I like a good rocky road, or pretty much any chocolate ice cream with nuts or stir-ins! I like most of Jeni's brand too. How about you? What is your favorite kind?", "I am a big fan of cookie dough ice cream, and I love cheesecake flavored ice creams too! Ben & Jerry has some that I like, but I prefer to get ice cream from an ice cream shop.  It's just something about being in that environment,", "Yes, ice cream shops are the best! They have stir-ins, and the smells are heavenly! Ben and Jerry's used to have a blueberry cheesecake that was amazing! I have only had that and their strawberry flavors. Both were great!", "YES! You get it. Now I want to go to an ice cream shop. I might apply for a part-time job at an ice cream shop since I'm not working.  Do you enjoy your job as a fry cook? I think the food & restaurant industries may be similar.", "Haha, I couldn't work at an ice cream shop because I would eat too much! You should do it though, if you have more self-control! I don't really like being a fry cook too much, but it pays my bills, and the people are great!"]}

Maybe you, your friend, and I can get together every week and share recipes, that way you can ease yourself into being vegan and find meal you enjoy", "That would be really helpful! And I know my friend is interested in exploring being vegan as well. Maybe in addition to sharing recipes we could try out a zumba class with you sometime?", "Yes of course! Zumba is great. And I know you mentioned you don't think you have the stamina for hiking, but we could try that too if you're interested. We don't have to start with anything too intense, maybe just some short trails and work our way up", "I think I could give hiking a try if we start out easy. And like you said, I'm hoping to have more energy when I start changing my diet. I'm feeling very motivated to change my lifestyle to be healthier. I'm hoping I can stay motivated, haha!", "That's what I'm for, to keep you motivated! It's always better to have an exercise partner so wee can feed off each other's energy!", "You're totally right! Trying to be healthy is really hard to do on your own. But I think this sounds like a good plan. The three of us can share recipes and help motivate each other with the exercise! We'll all be doing 8-hour hikes in no time!", "I'm feeling extra motivated just thinking about it! How about we shoot for this weekend? I can find a beginner Zumba class so you can get a feel for it.", "Great idea! You should invite some of your friends too. We could get a good group together. I'm feeling far less overwhelmed by this idea now that I'm thinking about everyone who will be helping me out!", "Yes I definitely will, the more the merrier! I'm so glad to hear that, it's not always easy trying new things but I'm glad you feel comfortable with it"]}

A cat only demands things of you when they want something specific (food, water, scratches, clean litter), but will totally ignore you a lot of the rest of the time. Buddy wants to be by my side 24/7. I also save on boarding when I travel because the cat can take care of himself. I always have to find Buddy a place to stay so he can be walked, etc. I'm definitely a dog person, but cats are chill in a whole different way. ", "That makes sense. Cats always see so self-sufficient. Like they could totally be on their own but decide to keep you around anyway, haha!

I'd say my parents are pretty chill though, so it's not unbearable. <parter> That is a good thing. Mine were too, but my mom would not have been cool in a room full of toddlers or teenagers.

You might have some experience here! <you> I do have kids. I didn't know the gender of 3 of them before they were born and people decided to buy what they wanted. I ended up with like fifty dresses for my son and nothing but overalls for my daughters haha. I knew the last one was going to be a girl. Luckily we saved her brothers dresses and she had stuff to wear.  <parter> oh wow! Yeah, i guess with gifts it may be better to know the gender beforehand. I'll have a think about it. How old are your children now? <you> Well the boy turned 18 last November and he's still living with his mom. The older girls are like 23 and 26 if I remember right. They don't talk to me much. Part of why I drink all the time. But my youngest daughter is about to be 16. Her mom still lives with me, and I am trying to get better for them. I am still thankful that my older kids mom let me have all the dresses when my daughter was born. We had saved them just in case, and she never had another kid. You should be excited though. Babies are blessings. <parter> I am really excited. My wife has been wanting a baby for years now, I wanted to deal with the alcohol before we had the baby however. I understand what you say about why you drink, we all have our own battles to face with this kind of stuff. I feel like im in a better state now, not long until the baby after all! <you> It is not easy to deal with a newborn and drink. I would advise getting it under control as much as possible. But after they get big enough to sleep through most nights, it isn't as hard to get in some drinks. Once they are teenagers and always running off with friends, it is easier for sure, because instead of waiting until after bedtime, you wait until they leave and then just sink into the bliss of not knowing your own name.

Have you even thought of doing the same?  <you> I have. I dont really know where to start. Or have anyone that would be a good sponsor. I just need to stop buying the stuff. <parter> Yeah it is difficult. Perhaps if you're struggling with money you could set aside an amount every week you would normally spend.

I'm sure your wife is so much happier now, especially knowing you're there for her and the baby. Part of my motivation to get sober is because I want to be able to see my kids grow up, all of them.

Are you going to have a home birth or go to the hospital?", "I'm excited, scared, nervous, overjoyed, and pretty much every other feeling I can imagine all at once! It's a lot to handle sometimes! But truthfully, more than anything, is the anticipation to finally see my baby for the first time. We are going to do the birth in the hospital, just to be safe.

Stress is obviously a big pitfall.", "Oh absolutely. What I'm learning in the meetings is that what really causes us to drink is unprocessed negative emotions and our discomfort with them. It's a struggle, but if we can learn to deal with those in a healthy way, that helps a lot.

That last one was especially terrifying. They are all healthy, now, though, including their mothers. I really hope that they allow me to see them again when I get clean.", "Wow, that's both scary and also somewhat reassuring.  It's scary to think of what all could go wrong, but reassuring to hear that there were issues with the births of all three of your kids but they're all healthy.", "Absolutely. I think where I went wrong was not having any purpose and not asking for emotional support. That led me to drinking and causing problems with my kids and their mothers.

Once I got under the water and adjusted to breathing through the air tank - it was really funny. I can't even describe the beauty. <parter> I really hope that I get to go one day. I can't even imagine how amazing that would be.  <you> You will love it. Once I did it the first time, I was hooked. I even want to do that thing, where you go into a steel cage and sharks come out. I find marine life so interesting. <parter> I think that would be amazing but I am so scared of sharks so I don't know if I would do it!  <you> That's understandable. Apparently, I am a bit of a thrill seeker. :) I am sure you will be studying about fear/emotions in your Neuroscience classes next year.", "session-03-persona": "I didn't know that shark attacks were higher in the summer because there are more seals then.

Did you know about that ?", "No, I had no idea. That'll make me feel much safer when I go diving. What are they attracted to then?", "I've heard sharks have a good sense of smell.  I was surprised to hear that it wasn't the blood since that's what you typically see in the movies etc.", "I had no idea. That's so interesting! That makes movies like Jaws completely different in real life. Does that make you any less worried about sharks when you go scuba diving sometime? ", "Yes, it gives me some comfort but not much.  It's always when we approach the summer months when you hear about increased shark attacks.  That's because the seal population has increased and the food is plentiful.", "I didn't know that about seals. O", "Oh yes, the seal population is high on the east coast.  There was a report on the television the other day about a huge shark located off of Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  They try to tag and track the sharks so they can keep their location known.", "That's so interesting. You have a lot of knowledge. When you study neuroscience, are you looking to do zoology and research with animals or are you looking to work with humans after college?", "I looking to work with humans.  It's so fascinating.  I hope some day I can help cure neurological diseases.", "I prefer animals to humans, but that's just because they are easier to get along with most of the time. :?) That's amazing what you're planning to do, though. There are so many terrible diseases that we can't cure yet.", "That's a funny comment.  I'm chuckling.  Yes, if we put our minds to it, I bet we can accomplish many things regarding diseases.  It's amazing over the course of the years how we've come up with many vaccines to eradicate infections diseases/viruses. ", "I know, right? We need to get all the research done that we can.

I love to scuva dive! Where do you dive to? I normally go to Hawaii to seek those types of thrills.", "I'm not sure; my friend said they'll let me know. Hawaii sounds awesome. What makes you want to go into neuroscience?", "It's something I've always fancied trying. I really love that sort of thing so want to give it a try. How do you plan to try and cure the neurological diseases? It may help me with my classes.", "Well, it's not that simple. It's science. You have to learn as much as you can, what's been tried before, what can be tried differently. I'd be fine with helping you, but let's wait until your classes start. When will that be, by the way?", "It'll be some time next year. Thank you for the offer to help! I think you should try to do some scuba diving... it's actually a lot of fun!", "Like I said, I'm waiting to hear back from my friend. Was there a job you wanted to have when you were in high school?", "I am a veteran so I just went straight to the army after high school. What about you?", "Thanks for your service, by the way. I always wanted to do something in the sciences, but my experience in the research lab really sealed the deal for neuroscience. I've been into that kind of stuff since I was a kid. Being out in nature for Eagle Scouts probably fueled it some, too.", "No worries. That sounds a lot of fun, I wish you good luck with your studies! How is your volunteering at the lab going?", "Oh, it's going great; thanks for asking. I'm going to need that luck. Once you finish yours, we can compare humans and animals. Think you'll study marine life or a different type of animal?"], "session-05-persona": "I just divorced my wife. I love to scuba dive in Hawaii. I have been to Hawaii three times.

But I think I just want my own place, less drama and more freedom that way.", "Yup. My parents wanted me to do the same thing...for \"that experience\". To be honest, I don't want it.

What city are you planning on moving to? <parter> I love the heat. I think I was born to just bake in the sun. I am thinking of Tampa. Which city would you go to? <you> If you love the heat, then you'll definitely like Florida. I haven't been to Tampa, but I did like Miami when I visited. I really enjoyed the beaches in Miami. Have you been to Florida before or will this be a new city for you? <parter> I have been before which is why I decided to move. The beaches were one of the main reasons actually. Imagine going out for lunch while at work to sit on the beach for 30 mins. <you> Oh yes, that does sound quite nice. I actually just remembered that I went through Tallahassee once briefly but it rained most of the time so I didn't do much. Do you have any family in Tampa? <parter> No, its more to get away from them. They are very strict and I feel I need a bit more freedom.  <you> Ah, that makes sense. Will you have any friends close by in Tampa or is this a totally fresh start for you? <parter> Completely fresh start. i am really excited about it! <you> Sounds like it will be really fun.
